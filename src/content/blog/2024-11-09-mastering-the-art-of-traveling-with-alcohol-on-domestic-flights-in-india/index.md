### By Rakesh Gangwar

Traveling with alcohol can often seem daunting, especially when moving between Indian states with varying regulations. If you're like Rishi, planning to travel from Delhi to Hyderabad with a hefty 10 liters of your favorite spirits, then this guide is perfect for you. Here‚Äôs how to smoothly navigate the skies with your liquid cargo while staying within legal limits.

### Understanding the Basics

- **Permissible Amount**: According to airlines' regulations, each passenger is allowed to carry up to 5 liters of alcohol in checked luggage on domestic flights. This means that Rishi can transport 10 liters if accompanied by a fellow traveler who can check in 5 liters under their name.
  
- **Packaging Guidelines**: To ensure safe passage, pack the bottles in a transparent, quart-sized zip-lock bag. For added security, use bubble wrap or dedicated wine sleeves to prevent breakage.

### Ensuring Compliance and Safety

- **Airline Policies**: Always check with the airline for any specific rules regarding alcohol transportation. Some airlines might have unique policies that require additional documentation or specific packaging standards.
  
- **State Regulations**: While carrying alcohol within permissible limits is generally smooth, it's crucial to be mindful of the differing laws across Indian states. Be sure to research Hyderabad‚Äôs alcohol regulations to avoid any surprises upon arrival.

### Pro Tips for a Smooth Journey

- **Secure Packing**: Use bubble wrap and keep bottles separate to minimize movement. Utilizing a box inside your suitcase can add an extra layer of protection.
  
- **Honesty is Key**: When checking in, be forthright if queried about your luggage‚Äôs contents. Transparency can prevent potential hold-ups or security issues.
